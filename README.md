# cam-processing-preview-demo

A simple app that demonstrates how to preview different local camera effects (i.e. background blur or replacement) before applying them to the live camera track that is shared with others on a call.

```bash
nvm i

npm i

# Run the dev server. It'll tell you what localhost URL to open in your browser.
npm run dev

# Now, edit `setupLiveCallClient()` in call-clients.ts to use your own Daily room url.
```
